Summery of the classes so far.

At the first lesson we had an introduction of Python and Phycharm. Also, we had an introduction of DataTypes like
Integer, String, Boolean, and Float. Moreover, we learned arithmetic operations and casting.

At the second lesson we learned more about each DataTypes and exercise to understand more.

At the fourth lesson we learned conditions: if, elif, else as well as ternary conditions.

At the last lesson was about Lists.

We do have classes three days a week.

I am adding more information to check the repository.
